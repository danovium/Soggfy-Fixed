# Soggfy-Fixed
This is my fork of Soggfy that separates contributing artists via a comma instead of a / 

# Why?
Using Soggfy is great, but playing back Songs on iTunes (or the iOS Music app) leads to inaccurate last.fm scrobbles and false search results (ex. Drake/Future is counted as one artist, instead of two seperate ones)

IF this is not an issue for you on regular Soggfy then you should probably not use this. 

# Linux? macOS?
I honestly don't plan to port to either of those. As the creator said, it relies too much on the Windows API to be ported.

However, given that it acts like a Spicetify plugin of sorts, it isn't impossible.

Maybe sometime in the future I'll take a look at it, as of right now, this is Windows only. (Wine will not work)

# Issues
In my testing, installing Soggfy does not apply its Theme correctly. Therefore the Download button will look a lot uglier. 
However, AD blocking and downloading itself should still work.

Another issue ive had is search being broken. I'm not exactly sure if this applies to other people, but if it does, I'm sorry.
You can play an album on your phone, then change the output device to be your PC. (or add it to your Library)
