This is my fork of Soggfy that saves contributing artists by separating them via a comma instead of a / 

# Why?

Using Soggfy is great, but playing back Songs on iTunes (or the iOS Music app) leads to inaccurate last.fm scrobbles and false search results (ex. Drake/Future is counted as one artist, instead of two seperate ones)

IF this is not an issue for you on regular Soggfy then you should probably not use this.
