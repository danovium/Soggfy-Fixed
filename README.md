# Soggfy-Fixed
This is my fork of Soggfy that separates contributing artists via a comma instead of a / 

# Why?
Using Soggfy is great, but playing back Songs on iTunes (or the iOS Music app) leads to inaccurate last.fm scrobbles and false search results (ex. Drake/Future is counted as one artist, instead of two seperate ones)

IF this is not an issue for you on regular Soggfy then you should probably not use this. 

# Linux? macOS?
I honestly don't plan to port to either of those. As the creator said, it relies too much on the Windows API to be ported.

However, given that it acts like a Spicetify plugin of sorts, it isn't impossible.

Maybe sometime in the future I'll take a look at it, as of right now, this is Windows only. (Wine will not work)

## Alternatives
- [OnTheSpot](https://github.com/justin025/onthespot) - supports Linux, macOS and Windows. has a nice GUI
- [Zotify (DraftKinner Repo)](https://github.com/DraftKinner/zotify) - Zotify fork maintained by DraftKinner, Python script to download songs via a Terminal
- [Spotizer](https://lavaforge.org/spotizerr) - Download manager, meant for Media Servers, supports downloading from Deezer for FLACs
- [DAB Music Player](https://dab.yeet.su/) - Music Downloads, recommended for Mobile Users
- [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/news/) - P2P platform for downloading music

  
Remember to support indie artists by buying their merch or simply donating, Spotify's payout isn't fair (0.0005$ per stream) but YOUR 5$ donation could equal to listening to their music over 1000 times. 


# Before Installing
Make sure that Real-time protection in Windows Security is turned off. Soggfy will still work even if you have it on, but the custom theme (and other stuff like blocking updates) won't work. 

Additionally, search will also be broken if it isn't disabled.

# Disclaimer
As with the original repo, this program should not be used to download music you don't physically or digitally own.

It is meant to showcase how music can be ripped from Spotify, without downloading them directly.

This fork also has the same risks of getting your account banned as the original one. Use an alt account or keep backups of your playlists.
